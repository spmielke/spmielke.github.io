## Protein Structure Estimation from Data Mining

### Project Description

#### Summary

Motivated by the need for fast, reliable methods of assessing protein structure in the era of big genomics, this continuing effort seeks to provide data-derived tools for high-throughput structural characterization of proteins directly from traditional (e.g., HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, prior to resonance assignment. By correlating the NMR chemical shifts and structure content of proteins of known conformation, these tools allow accurate, real-time estimation of secondary structure in previously uncharacterized proteins.

Projects contributing to this effort have, e.g., 1) demonstrated an empirical correlation between the averaged chemical shift (ACS) of protein backbone nuclei and observed secondary structure (&alpha;&#8209;helix and &beta;&#8209;strand) content as a fraction of overall conformation (Sibley, Monique, Krish); 2) confirmed these results by applying rigorous statistical methods (see below) to establish further correlations between ACS and protein structural classes (Mielke, Krishnan \[all relevant\]); and 3) extended the foregoing by ... \[deep learning\] ... (..., Krishnan).

#### Impacts

... "the observed correlation between ACS and SSC can be used to monitor structural changes in real time, such as in protein folding experiments, to detect large-scale structural changes in complex formation and to identify initial protein folds in high throughput proteomics applications." ... \[cf., our similar statement\] ...
